         <p>Copy/Paste the tutorial CSS found here into src/index.css

This tutorial will be creating, reading, searching, updating, and deleting data. A typical web app would probably be talking to an API on your web server, but we're going to use browser storage and fake some network latency to keep this focused. None of this code is relevant to React Router, so just go ahead and copy/paste it all.

ðŸ‘‰ Copy/Paste the tutorial data module found here into src/contacts.js

All you need in the src folder are contacts.js, main.jsx, and index.css. You can delete anything else (like App.js and assets, etc.).</p>
    </div>
